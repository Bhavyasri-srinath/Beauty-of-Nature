            <p>Beauty of Nature is an educational organization designed to help people re-connect<br> 
               with  the  beauty and  vitality of  the natural  world. Our underlying philosophy,<br> 
               supported by scientific research, is that sustaining a deep connection with nature <br>
               is fundamental for human health and well-being.</p>
               <br>
            <p>Research  has  shown  that  time  spent  mindfully  engaging  with  nature is very <br>
               effective for increasing resilience, decreasing  stress, boosting  creativity  and <br>
               improving  memory  and cognitive function. Contact with the natural world has also <br>
               been shown to improve  physical health  through reducing  inflammation, increasing <br>
               immune function, and supporting the body’s natural healing process.</p>   
               <br>
            <p>At Beauty of nature we run workshops,courses, tours, and retreats that show people <br>
               how to mindfully engage with nature in a deep and sustained  way, teaching skills, <br>
               practices, techniques and exercises to help you get the most benefit for your mind <br>
               and body out of your contact with the natural world.</p>
               <br>
            <p>Through working with us you will learn to use the  natural world as  a resource to <br>
                help support you in stress management and  improving the overall quality  of your <br>
                life. This can be done by learning  ways to connect with nature  on a daily basis <br>
                that provide mental and physical nourishment.</p>

               <h1>About Me</h1>
               <p> My name is Bhavya Sri.Iam pursuing my Bachelor of Engineering in  Electronics and <br>
                   Communication Engineering.Iam a blogger and Web Developer.</p>
                   <br>
               <p> From a very young age I have always been fascinated by the natural world ,I loved <br>
                   to play and connect with nature, sensing intuitively the goodness that was  to be <br>
                   found  there.  Being in  the  outdoors  has always  been the  greatest  source of <br>
                   sustenance, energy, and  inspiration for  me and I  love activities like surfing, <br>
                   hiking and swimming that allow me to engage with the  natural world, providing my <br>
                   life with a rich fount of well-being.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Combining mindfulness practice with nature experiences brings together two things <br>
                   I am very passionate about. The sense of peace,  calm,  joy, and well-being  that <br>
                   are found in both has a  huge  resource  in helping me in my own life and this is <br>
                   something I am very motivated to share  with others. The combined health hit they <br>
                   contain, I believe, provides the perfect antidote  to the stress and busy-ness of <br>
                   modern life.</p>
