         <p>The absence of a deep emotional connection between humans and the natural world is at the <br>
            root of the environmental crisis.</p> <br>

         <P>Can you think of a place in nature that you know really well?</P> <br>

         <P>Close your eyes for a moment and see what comes up.</P><br>

         <p>Can you visualise the place in exquisite detail? The sounds, the colours, the smells, the <br>
            subtleties that only you know.</p><br>

         <p>Do memories surface? Perhaps you have known this place for a long time. Maybe you spent golden <br>
            moments from your childhood here? There might be happy memories tinged with sadness or regret?<br>
            How does it feel when you bring this place to mind now?</p><br>

         <P>Please don’t rush. Take a moment to</P><br>

         <P>Now another question</P><br>

         <p>How would you feel if this same place was under imminent threat? Imagine someone is destroying<br>
            it right now. What do you feel? Anger? Sadness? Shock? Resignation? Nothing at all?</p> <br>

         <p>Can you imagine that you might actually do something immediate and tangible to help protect this place?<br>
            Be honest with yourself.</p> <br>

         <p>If you really have a deep connection with this place, it is likely that you might feel moved to do<br>
            something. That’s obvious, right? We naturally and instinctively act to protect that which we care very <br>
            deeply about.</p> <br>

         <p>But what if that deep connection with a place is absent? How would that affect your response? It’s a<br>
            beautiful place but it’s not your place. Are you still likely to do something about it? Is it your<br>
            responsibility?</p> <br>

         <P>Let me paint two scenarios for you…</P> <br>

         <p>You are walking through town at night and you see your best friend looking dishevelled, sleeping rough <br>
            on the street. You haven’t seen him for six months. There is probably an initial shock: “Oh my God, <br>
            what happened?!!” You instinctively reach out for him. Before you know it your arm is on his shoulder:<br>
            “Come home with me. Let me take care of you”.</p> <br>

         <p>Now another night. This time you see a random stranger looking dishevelled, sleeping rough on the street.<br>
            Be honest. What do you do? Is it someone else’s problem? If your heart is big enough you might give him <br>
            some money or buy him a sandwich but is he coming home to sleep on your couch? Perhaps you rationalise <br>
            your inaction by reminding yourself that you donate to the local homeless charity. You might remind yourself<br> 
            to vote for a politician who appears committed to doing something. But most of the time most of us don’t do <br>
            anything at all.</p> <br>

         <p>Why the difference? It’s obvious isn’t it… in the first scenario you don’t even think. You have a deep <br>
            emotional connection with your best friend and you have to act. In the second scenario you might feel <br>
            sad and you might recognise the tragedy of the situation but there is no emotional connection between<br>
            the two of you, so more often than not you don’t act.</p> <br>

         <p>John Steinbeck put it very well when he wrote (at a time when there was famine in China): “It means very<br>
            little to know that a million Chinese are starving unless you know one Chinese who is starving.” There <br>
            needs to be an emotional connection for the thing to have any meaning.</p> <br>

         <p>It is the very same when it comes to the environmental crisis. There is a groundswell of support at the <br>
            moment for taking steps to avert climate change. The reality that there is a problem seems to have finally<br> 
            dawned on a lot of people. But still most people don’t really “do” anything significant do they? I’m not <br>
            being self-righteous or judgemental here. I know that I’m guilty of it myself. Why are we all so passive? <br>
            Why do we wait for someone else to do something?</P> <br>

         <P>There are a number of reasons and it’s not simple (and I certainly don’t have the answer). I have thought<br>
            about it a lot though and I have some ideas:</P> <br>

         <P>The sheer scale of the problem is so frightening, most of us don’t feel capable of doing anything meaningful.<br> 
            The tree is about to fall down and I am just a tiny ant!</P> <br>

         <P>Society as currently constructed is designed to make us passive and docile. We lead incredibly busy lives… <br>
            commute, work, eat, exercise, shop, look after the kids, more work, Netflix, bed. Most of us just sleepwalk <br>
            through life on automatic pilot waiting for the next brief window of pleasure. One day blending into the next.<br> 
            We have hardly any time to reflect, let alone act.</P> <br>

         <P>Many in society feel socially isolated. The sense of community has broken down. Loneliness is an epidemic at <br>
            the moment. If you feel like you are on your own, you are far less likely to summon up the courage to do <br>
            something. The Titanic is sinking and you are just one person with a bucket. Everyone else on the boat is<br>
            a stranger to you. What’s the point?</P> <br>

         <P>Perhaps the biggest reason we do nothing is that most of us have lost the sense of deep connection with the <br>
            natural world that our ancestors took for granted. If you don’t feel deeply connected to nature, you obviously<br>
            don’t care about it in the same way and you are far less likely to do something immediate and meaningful. <br>
            It’s the same reason why you ignore the homeless person you don’t know.</P> <br>

         <P>So what can you do?</P> <br>

         <p>I don’t have the answer. It does however seem to me that passing various pieces of legislation, banning single<br>
            use plastics and imposing carbon taxes is essentially treating the symptom and not the disease. Like an obese <br>
            person with type 2 diabetes who goes to the doctor because he has high blood pressure and takes a tablet every <br>
            day without fundamentally changing the way he lives his life, and more importantly changing his relationship <br>
            with himself. I’m not saying that strong legislative action isn’t essential. It obviously is, but the root goes<br>
            much deeper. </p> <br>

         <p>It is probably a good idea for you to start very small. You can do something and maybe others will follow. <br>
            It’s also great if you don’t feel like you are on your own. Can you find and connect with a community of <br>
            others who feel the same way as you? Here is a small example to show you what I’m talking about…</p> <br>

         <p>I live in an apartment complex in a suburb of Dublin. One day I saw one of the gardeners spraying the lawn<br>
            with pesticides. He was wearing a mask because he didn’t want to ingest those chemicals himself. I spoke <br>
            with him. He was a nice man, just doing his job. I could have left it there but I didn’t because I felt <br>
            something… anger, sadness, defiance, some strength. Why is this happening to my place?! I put up a petition<br>
            which was promptly taken down by the management company. But it was still seen and lo and behold, some other<br>
            people who live here agreed that we should stop spraying the gardens where we live. So suddenly there is <br>
            community. I’m not one person on a sinking ship with a bucket. There is some strength in numbers and there<br>
            is the possibility of something positive happening. It’s a drop in the ocean but it counts.</p> <br>
            
         <p>Most importantly, to get to the root of this problem we need to rediscover the deeper connection with nature <br>
            which we have lost. Mindfulness is one way of cultivating this connection. It takes time and patience. Two <br>
            things in life which are in very short supply.</p> <br>
            
         <p>The Irish poet Patrick Kavanagh expressed it beautifully: “To know fully one field or one land is a lifetime’s<br>
            experience. In the world of poetic experience it is depth that counts, not width. A gap in a hedge, a smooth <br>
            rock surfacing a narrow lane, a view of woody meadows, the stream at the junction of four small fields – these <br>
            are as much as any man can fully experience.”</p> <br>
            
         <p>Most of us have neither the time nor the inclination to pursue a deeper nature experience… for the masses it <br>
            is width that counts, not depth. We are addicted to new experiences. Consuming new places in a very shallow <br>
            and meaningless way. A nice photograph for Instagram and another place ticked off the list.</p> <br>
            
         <p>What about the places we habituate? The lane we pass on our way to work. The horse chestnut tree in the field<br>
            overlooking the car park. The park where we walk the dog. The canal where we eat our lunch everyday.</p> <br>
            
         <p>Do you stop and listen to the trees stirring in the breeze? Do you notice the first leaves of spring and the <br>
            very last leaves of winter? Do you know the call of each songbird? Have you noticed how the character of a <br>
            place changes day by day and even moment by moment?</p> <br>

         <P>Can you slow down and pay attention in these moments?</P> <br>

         <P>It’s a drop in the ocean but it counts.</p>
